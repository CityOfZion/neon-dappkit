# NeonParser

To use NeonParser you can simply import and use it's methods, since it's a constant object.

```ts
import { NeonParser } from '@cityofzion/neon-dappkit'

const tenAsHex = NeonParser.intToHex(10)
```

All NeonParser methods are documented via unit testing and can be easily read [here](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-dappkit/blob/main/packages/neon-dappkit/test/NeonParser.spec.ts)
